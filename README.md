### Living Universe Theory (Definition)

"The Living Universe Theory proposes that since all matter in the universe—down to atoms, electrons, and protons—is in constant motion, and movement is a key characteristic of life, the universe itself can be considered a living entity. Although not alive in the biological sense, its continuous activity and interconnected structure reflect qualities often associated with living systems."
