# 🌌 Living Universe Theory

> _"A thought-provoking perspective on the nature of the universe as a living, dynamic system."_

## 📖 Definition

**The Living Universe Theory** proposes that, because all matter in the universe—down to atoms, electrons, and protons—is in constant motion, and movement is a fundamental characteristic of life, the universe itself can be considered a form of living entity.  

While not alive in the biological sense, its continuous activity and deeply interconnected structure reflect qualities commonly associated with living systems.

## 💡 Core Ideas

- **Constant Motion**  
  Everything in the universe, even at the smallest scales (atoms, electrons), is always moving — just like living organisms.

- **Interconnection**  
  Just like systems in biology, parts of the universe interact in complex and dynamic ways, forming a larger whole.

- **Non-Biological Life**  
  This theory challenges the idea that "life" must be biological, proposing a broader, more universal view of what life can mean.

## 🧠 Purpose

This theory is not intended to redefine biology, but to invite philosophical and scientific reflection on how we view the universe:

- Can a system without cells or DNA still be considered "alive" in some form?
- Is constant motion and interaction enough to qualify as a form of life?
- How do systems theory, physics, and philosophy intersect in this idea?

## 🧑‍💻 About the Creator

This theory was proposed by me and aspiring software engineer interested in combining logic, science, and philosophy. It reflects a curiosity-driven attempt to understand the universe from both a technical and abstract perspective.
